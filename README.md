# SpotMyFile

SpotMyFile is an open-source tool for blazing-fast file and image search on your PC. Leveraging state-of-the-art AI, semantic text embeddings, face recognition, and object detection, it helps you find exactly what you need—by keyword, image, or even faces.

## Demo

## Features

### File Search
- **Text Embedding Search**: Index and search files using text embeddings for semantic similarity
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine vector embeddings with BM25 lexical search for improved results
- **Adaptive Batching**: Process files in batches optimized for memory usage
- **Caching**: Features are cached to optimize repeated searches and reduce processing time
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Efficiently process files with parallel extraction and embedding

### Image Recognition
- **Face Recognition**: Identify and match faces in images using a pre-trained face recognition model
- **Object Detection**: Utilize YOLOv4 for real-time object detection in images
- **Batch Processing**: Process images in memory-efficient batches
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract and cache image features for quick retrieval
- **Thread-safe Operations**: Safely process images in multi-threaded environments

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture:

- **Indexers**: `FileIndexer` and `ImageIndexer` process and store features
- **Searchers**: `FileSearcher` and `ImageSearcher` retrieve relevant content
- **Cache Manager**: Store embeddings and features for efficient retrieval
- **Extractors**: Generate embeddings and features from content

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- tqdm
- face_recognition
- YOLOv4 configuration and weights

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishabh705/SpotMyFile.git
   cd SpotMyFile
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the YOLOv4 weights, configuration, and COCO names files:

   - [yolov4.weights](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/yolov4/yolov4.weights)
   - [yolov4.cfg](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov4.cfg?raw=true)
   - [coco.names](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names?raw=true)

4. Configure your environment variables in a `.env` file:

   ```env
   FOLDER_PATH=path/to/your/content
   ```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: The system uses batching to manage memory usage when processing large numbers of files or images
- **Thread Count**: Adjust `max_workers` based on your system's resources and the I/O vs CPU characteristics of your workload
